This notebook is designed to give a quick interactive overview of the MSIS model and how adjusting the input parameters affects the upper atmosphere. We will go through a few quick examples and demonstrations.

If you prefer a web interface to coding, there is also an interactive website here: [https://msis.swx-trec.com/visualizer](https://msis.swx-trec.com/visualizer) that you can follow along with and download all of the necessary data.

## NRL Mass Spectrometer, Incoherent Scatter Radar Extended Model (MSIS)

The MSIS model is developed by the Naval Research Laboratory.

Note that the MSIS2 code is not available for commercial use without contacting NRL. See the MSIS2 license file for explicit details. We do not repackage any of the MSIS source code in this repository for that reason. However, we do provide utilities to easily download and extract the original source code. By using that code you agree to their terms and conditions.
